\section{Purpose}
The different programs that are part of the \mmbtools each have their own
documentation regarding command-line options and configuration settings, and the
opendigitalradio.org wiki contains many explanations and pointers, but there is
no single source of documentation available for the whole tool-set.

This document aims to solve this, by first outlining general concepts,
presenting different usage scenarios and detailing a complete transmission
setup.

With this document in hand, you should be able to understand all elements
composing a \mmbtools transmission chain.
