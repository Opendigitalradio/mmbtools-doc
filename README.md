Documentation for ODR-mmbTools
==============================

This repository contains a LaTeX document that summarises the ODR-mmbTools.
The goal is to create something like a manual for the whole tool-set, which
complements the man-pages and documentation for each part with a more
global perspective.

It also complements the opendigitalradio.org wiki.

Latest Version
--------------

It is a work in progress. No version has been released yet, but the
document gets compiled automatically by Travis-CI and uploaded to
http://opendigitalradio.github.io/mmbtools-doc/mmbtools.pdf
