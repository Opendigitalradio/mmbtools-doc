\section{Data Features}
\subsection{Announcements}
The ODR-DabMux multiplexer supports the insertion of FIG 0/18 and FIG 0/19 that
are used to define and trigger announcements according to ETSI TR 101 496-2
Clause 3.6.8~\cite{etsitr1014962}.
An example configuration is available in the ODR-DabMux repository, in
\texttt{doc/advanced.mux}.

The best known application for announcements is traffic information, but other
kinds of announcements can also be signalled. ODR-DabMux allows triggering the
announcements through the telnet and ZMQ remote control interfaces.

\subsection{Service Linking}
ODR-DabMux also supports the ability to inform receivers about other ways to
receive a given service, through the FIGs 0/6, 0/21 and 0/24. FIG 0/6
communicates the identifiers of services linked together, 0/21 informs the
receiver about other frequencies, and 0/24 includes information about other DAB
ensembles carrying the linked service.
Their interaction is outlined in ETSI TS 103 176~\cite{etsits103176}.

You will find an example configuration in the ODR-DabMux repository, in
\texttt{doc/servicelinking.mux}.
